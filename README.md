# HTML5-Platformer
HTML5/JS 2d Platformer - a work in progress

This project is meant to be a SNES-style platforming game which will be playable on most platforms including desktop and mobile.

It is still being worked on, and many changes are still being made.

Feel free to try the live demo [here](http://sam-opdahl.github.io).
