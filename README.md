# HTML5-Platformer
HTML5/JS 2d Platformer - a work in progress

This project is meant to be a simple SNES-style platforming game which will be playable on most platforms including desktop and mobile.

It is still being worked on, and many changes are still being made.

Feel free to try the live demo [here](http://samopdahl.site11.com/default.html).
The demo may not always be completely up to date, but it should be pretty close.
